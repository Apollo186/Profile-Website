            <h3>Language: Java</h3>
            <p>I took a computer program design course in university and it was course about Java</p>
            <p>We had a semester long project where we had to create an asteroid game given UML designs given by the professor</p>
            <p>The player is a rocket ship in space trying to survie as long as possible by either shooting the asteroids or evading them</p>

            <h1>Music Playlist</h1>
            <h3>Language: Python</h3>
            <p>In my first CS course, we learned python, and we had a project where we had to create a music playlist</p>
            <p>The user has to use a specific login to be able to see the playlists</p>
            <p>There are three playlists to choose from, Top Hits, My Mix, and Top 2010s </p>
            <p>Once the user selects the playlists, they can shuffle it, shorten it, or exit</p>

            <h1>Embedded Systems Project</h1>
            <h3>Language: C/Python</h3>
            <p>The final project for my microprocessor lab was to make a gui that can read data from an MSP430FR2355 microcontroller</p>
            <p>We had to read the x,y,z directions, noise detection, and what buttons are being pressed</p>
            <p>We made the GUI using python in a juptyer notebook, and wrote the the C code in the Energia IDE</p>
